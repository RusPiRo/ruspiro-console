//! # Console abstraction
//! 
//! This crate provides a console abstraction to enable string output to a configurable output channel.
//! It also provides the convinient macros (``print!`` and ``println!``) to output text that are usually not 
//! available in ``[no_std]`` environments. However this crate also provide macros to indicate the severity of the 
//! message that shall be printed. Those are ``info!``, ``warn!`` and ``error!``.
//! 
//! # Dependencies
//! As this crate uses macros to provide formatted strings it depends on the alloc crate. When using this crate
//! therefore a heap memory allocator has to be provided to successfully build and link. This could be a custom baremetal
//! allocator as provided with the corresponding crate ``ruspiro_allocator``.
//! 
//! # Usage
//! 
//! As the console crate refers to functions and structures of the ``core::alloc`` crate the final binary need to be linked
//! with a custom allocator. However, the ``ruspiro-console`` can bring the RusPiRo specific allocator if you activate the
//! feature ``with_allocator`` like so:
//! ```
//! [dependencies]
//! ruspiro-console = { version = "0.2", features = ["with_allocator"] }
//! ```
//! 
//! To actually set an active output channel you need to provide a structure that implements the ``ConsoleImpl`` trait. This
//! for excample is done in the Uart like so:
//! ```
//! impl ConsoleImpl for Uart1 {
//!     fn putc(&self, c: char) {
//!         self.send_char(c);
//!     }
//! 
//!     fn puts(&self, s: &str) {
//!         self.send_string(s);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! If this trait has been implemented this structure can be used as actual console. To use it there should be the following
//! code written at the earliest possible point in the main crate of the binary (e.g. the kernel)
//! ```
//! use ruspiro_console::*;
//! use ruspiro_uart::*; // as we demonstrate with the Uart.
//! 
//! fn demo() {
//!     let mut uart = Uart1::new(); // create a new uart struct
//!     if uart.initialize(250_000_000, 115_200).is_ok() { // initialize the Uart with fixed core rate and baud rate
//!         CONSOLE.take_for(|cons| cons.replace(uart)); // from this point CONSOLE takes ownership of Uart
//!         // uncommenting the following line will give compiler error as uart is moved
//!         // uart.send_string("I'm assigned to a console");
//!     }
//! 
//!     // if everything went fine uart should be assigned to the console for generic output
//!     println!("Console is ready and display's through uart");
//! }
//! ```
//! # Features
//! 
//! - ``with_allocator`` this will bring the ``ruspiro-allocator`` which is usefull if you don't want to provide your own
//! when using this crate.
